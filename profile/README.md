# BigNtertainment

Welcome to the BigNtertainment Github organisation.
We at BigNtertainment believe in the idea of open-source software, that's why we try to open-source as many of our repositories as possible.
Feel free to open issues on our repositories or create PRs to projects that are still active and open for code contributions
(if they aren't, it should be included it the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).

## Our website

If you'd like to play our games, read our blog, or get to know us more, visit [our website](BigNtertainment.github.io).
