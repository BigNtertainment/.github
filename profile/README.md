# BigNtertainment

Welcome to the BigNtertainment Github organisation.
We at BigNtertainment believe in the idea of open-source software, that's why we try to open-source as many of our repositories as possible.
Feel free to open issues on our repositories or create PRs to projects that are still active and open for code contributions
(if they aren't, it should be included it the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).

## Technologies

Most of our work is done in Rust, in the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine. One of our long term goals is to create our own game engine
called BigNgine. We have already given it a shot, but it didn't turn out how we wanted it to, mainly due to our inexperience. After making some games with Bevy,
we aim to remake the engine in Rust.
